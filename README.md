# Empty-Yahoo-Mail-Inbox
A script that will empty your yahoo mail inbox (Updated to work as of 3/2/2024, from the script by yomr)

If you have thousands of mails in your yahoo inbox, then it is very difficult to go and manually delete all the mails.
This is a quick script written by me that will delete all your inbox within few seconds, automatically!

####Note: This script will delete all the mails from the inbox. If you wish to stop deleting mid-way, you can close the browser opened by the script. This will stop the execution of the script.

###Setup

1) You will need python-selenium driver installed on your machine, gloabally or in your virtualenv(preferred).

`pip install selenium`

2) You will need Firefox web browser on your system.

###Running the script

1) Clone the repository on your machine

`git clone https://github.com/Ernest103/Empty-Yahoo-Mail-Inbox.git`

2) Navigate to the directory and run the script as

`python delete_mails.py`
