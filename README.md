# Empty-Yahoo-Mail-Inbox
A script that will empty your yahoo mail inbox

If you have thousands of mails in your yahoo inbox, then it is very difficult to go and manually delete all the mails.
This is a quick script written by me that will delete all your inbox within few seconds, automatically!

####Note: This script will delete all the mails from the inbox. If you wish to stop deleting mid-way, you can close the browser opened by the script. This will stop the execution of the script.

I will soon add a support, that will take the number of mails to be deleted as an input parameter.

###Setup

1) You will need python-selenium driver installed on your machine, gloabally or in your virtualenv(preferred).

`pip install selenium`

2) You will need Firefox web browser on your system.

###Running the script

1) Clone the repository on your machine

`git clone https://github.com/yomr/Empty-Yahoo-Mail-Inbox.git`

2) Navigate to the directory and run the script as

`python delete_mails.py`
